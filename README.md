AutoFAX
by MERS (Siying Sun, Rongrong miao, Matthew and Elaine Chao)

This is a rogram which automatically scans incoming faxes for relevant information, then uploads it to the patientâ€™s chart, filling in the appropriate information based on a scan of the text in the document. The program could also alert doctors of essential lab results that need to be looked at right away. By automating this process, this could prevent a lot of unnecessary organizational work. 





Running the main program:
$ python3 main.py

To configure the program for your operating system, modify the config.ini file.
DefaultTemplateLocation is where the program will save your templates.
DefaultPDFLocation is where the program will open to look for PDFs.
Do NOT commit this file. There should be a .gitignore to prevent this.

IMPORTANT KIVY CONFIG NOTES:
- when using a trackpad, Kivy can experience weird input issues on Ubuntu, due to trying to register the trackpad as both a touchscreen and a mouse. To disable this, go to the kivy config.ini file (under Ubuntu, located at ~/.kivy/config.ini) and under the [input] section, delete the entry related to probesys. This disables the touchscreen functionality.

- by default, Kivy allows for simulated multitouch by right clicking with the mouse. To disable this, in the kivy config file, under the [input] section, change the line "mouse = mouse" to "mouse = mouse,disable_multitouch"
